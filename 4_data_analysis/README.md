# Data Analysis 📊
## Overview

This folder contains the data analysis files. Building upon the exploratory data analysis from the `UpdatedData` folder in`3_data_exploration` folder, this phase focuses on developing and evaluating predictive models to answer our research question about student engagement, satisfaction, and performance.

##  Dataset 1: **[`First dataset`](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/blob/main/4_data_analysis/data_analysis.ipynb)**

**Summary of Findings**

- Students’ marks improved after online learning, with most students showing a similar increase.

- Study hours, sleep hours, and social media usage showed no strong direct relationship with final marks.

- Gender differences were minimal, with male and female students performing similarly.

- Device type and home location had minor effects, with laptop/desktop users and urban students showing slightly more consistent performance.

- Engagement was strongly related to study hours and negatively related to social media use, but only weakly related to marks.

**Key insight**: Academic performance remained relatively stable and was not strongly driven by individual lifestyle variables in this dataset.

## Dataset 2: 

**Summary of Findings**

- Most students reported Low or Moderate adaptability, with only a small share reporting High adaptability.

- Financial condition was the strongest factor associated with high adaptability.

- Better infrastructure (WiFi, 4G networks, low load-shedding) significantly improved adaptability.

- Students using computers or tablets adapted better than those relying on mobile phones.

- Gender, IT background, and LMS usage had limited influence.

**Key insight:** Adaptability to online learning is shaped more by resources and infrastructure than by personal characteristics.

## Dataset 3:

**Summary of Findings**

- Students’ learning habits during COVID-19 varied widely.

- Higher self-study time and better-rated online classes were associated with positive time utilization.

- High social media usage was linked to poorer time utilization.

- Device type had minimal influence on outcomes.

**Key insight:** Students’ perceived productivity is moderately predictable, with study habits and class quality playing a stronger role than device or demographics.
