# Communication Strategy
### Goal

The goal of this phase is to ensure that the insights from the data analysis reach audiences who can learn from and reflect on students’ online learning experiences. Rather than simply presenting results, this strategy outlines how the findings can be communicated clearly, accessibly, and meaningfully to relevant audiences.

### The Core Artifact:  

primary communication artifact is this GitHub repository, which contains:

- cleaned datasets

- exploratory analysis notebooks

- visualizations

- summary documentation

**This format is appropriate because it is:**

- Transparent: all analysis steps are clearly documented,

- Accessible: readable by both technical and non-technical reviewers,

- Reusable: future students or researchers can build on the work.

### Target Audiences and Rationale
- Primary Audience: Students and Educators

**Why**
They are directly affected by online learning and can relate to findings on performance, adaptability, and time utilization.

**Value to them**

- Better understanding of factors that influence engagement and learning outcomes.

- Evidence-based reflection on online learning challenges.

- Secondary Audience: Academic Reviewers and Peers

**Why**
This project demonstrates applied data exploration, feature engineering, and interpretation across multiple datasets.

**Value to them**

- A clear example of end-to-end exploratory data analysis.

- Reproducible workflows and well-documented insights.

- Strategic Audience: Future Learners and Researchers

**Why**
Students interested in data science or education research may use this work as a reference.

**Value to them**

Clean datasets for practice.

Examples of how to move from raw data to meaningful insights.

### Key Messages

- The communication will emphasize the following messages derived from the analysis:

- Student performance often improves after online learning, but outcomes vary by engagement and context.

- Adaptability to online education is strongly influenced by access to technology and infrastructure.

- Student engagement and study habits matter more than demographic characteristics alone.

- During COVID-19, time utilization differed widely, with self-study time and reduced social media use linked to better outcomes.

### Communication Formats

**The findings will be shared through:**

- Colab Notebooks with inline explanations and visualizations,

- README summarizing datasets, methods, and results,

- charts such as histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to highlight patterns.

- If needed, the analysis could also be adapted into presentation slides or a short written article hosted externally.

### Communication Channels

- GitHub repository for code, data, and documentation

- Course submission platform for evaluation

### Expected Impact

This communication strategy ensures that the project’s findings are understandable, reusable, and relevant, supporting reflection on online learning experiences and encouraging data-informed discussions in educational contexts.
