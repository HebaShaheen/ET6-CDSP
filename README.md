**Over the past two years, Gaza has experienced repeated disruptions to its education system due to war and displacement. Many universities have been damaged or closed, forcing students to depend on online or alternative learning methods.**


## M0: Project Overview
Over the past two years, universities in Gaza have faced severe disruptions due to continuous conflict and instability. Many campuses have been damaged or closed, forcing thousands of students and professors to shift rapidly to online learning. While this transition offered a temporary solution, it also revealed deep challenges in digital access, mental health, and academic performance. 

Limited internet connectivity, electricity shortages, and the lack of laptops or smartphones have made it difficult for students to attend virtual classes consistently. Instructors also struggled to adapt traditional teaching methods to online formats, affecting the quality of education and student engagement. 

Despite these obstacles, the academic community in Gaza has shown resilience—adopting creative solutions such as recorded lectures, mobile-based learning, and flexible assessment methods. This project aims to highlight the impact of war and displacement on higher education, evaluate the effectiveness of online learning in crisis conditions, and propose strategies to strengthen the resilience of universities in future emergencies.
