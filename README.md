**Students’ Adaptability and the Effectiveness of Online Learning in Recent Years**

## Project Overview
Over the past several years, online learning has become one of the most significant transformations in global education. From the sudden shift during the COVID-19 pandemic to the continued use of digital platforms today, students across all educational levels schools and universities have had to adapt quickly to new learning environments. This transition created opportunities for flexible, accessible education, but it also exposed major challenges in engagement, academic performance, and digital readiness.


## [M1: Domain Study](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/0_domain_study)

how students have adapted to online learning in recent years and which factors most strongly influence the effectiveness of online education. By analyzing global datasets, academic research, and survey data, the project aims to:

- Understand students’ adaptability levels across different education level

- Identify barriers that affect online learning success

- Evaluate changes in student engagement and performance

- Highlight which digital or instructional strategies lead to more effective online learning


## [M2: Data Collection](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/1_datasets)
I used three publicly available datasets collected from Kaggle, all based on student responses related to online learning. The datasets cover different aspects of students’ online education experiences, including academic performance, adaptability to online learning, and time utilization during the COVID-19 period.

The datasets provides information on student learning environments, technology access, engagement, and academic performance before and during online learning. The Students Adaptability Level in Online Education dataset focuses on students’ adaptability and examines the role of infrastructure, devices, and financial conditions. The COVID-19 and its Impact on Students dataset captures students’ daily habits and perceived productivity during online learning.

Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of students’ online learning experiences across different contexts and time periods.

## [M3: Data Preparation](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/2_data_preparation)

I focused on preparing the raw datasets for analysis. Each notebook in this folder starts by reading the original datasets from the 1_datasets/ directory. I then cleaned the data by removing duplicates, correcting column names, handling inconsistent values, and ensuring that variables were in suitable formats for analysis.

## [M4: Data Exploration](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/3_data_exploration)

I explored three cleaned datasets related to online education, adaptability, and time utilization. Building on the prepared data from the data preparation stage, I used descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand distributions, patterns, and relationships within each dataset.

## [M5: Data Analysis](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/4_data_analysis)

I built it on the exploratory data to examine patterns related to student engagement, adaptability, satisfaction, and performance across three datasets. I analyzed each dataset separately, using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and predictive modeling to understand key trends and relationships in online learning experiences.

Overall, this analysis showed that engagement, access to resources, and learning conditions are more influential in shaping online learning outcomes than demographic characteristics alone.

## [M6: Communicating Results](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/5_communication_strategy)
I focused on planning how to communicate the insights from the data analysis in a clear and accessible way. I used the GitHub repository as the main communication artifact, as it allows the work to be transparent, reusable, and easy to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences. The communication strategy targets educators, students, academic peers, and future researchers, with key messages centered on student performance, adaptability, engagement, and time utilization in online learning.

## [M7: Final Presentation](https://github.com/HebaShaheen/ET6-CDSP/tree/main/6_final_presentation)
The final presentation brings together the full data science workflow of this project, highlighting the motivation, datasets, methods, and key findings related to students’ online learning experiences. It presents insights from three datasets. The presentation emphasizes how engagement, access to technology, and study habits influence learning outcomes, while also outlining directions for future work. The slides are designed to communicate the project clearly through visuals and concise explanations.
