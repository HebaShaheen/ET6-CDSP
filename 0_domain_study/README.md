### 1. Education in Gaza: Overview

Gaza Strip has experienced repeated conflict and political instability over the past decade. These disruptions have severely affected the education system, including universities. According to reports from UNRWA, UNICEF, and local educational authorities, higher education institutions have faced challenges such as:

Physical damage to campus infrastructure.

Temporary closures of universities due to security threats.

Limited access to electricity and internet connectivity.

### 2. Shift to Online Learning

During the last two years of intensified conflict, universities had to move classes online to ensure academic continuity. While this transition was necessary, it created several challenges:

Digital divide: Many students lacked reliable internet or devices to attend classes.

Limited technical infrastructure: Universities struggled to provide stable online platforms.

Instructor adaptation: Faculty had to quickly redesign courses for online delivery, often without prior training.

Student engagement and performance: Attendance dropped, and academic outcomes were affected due to interruptions, stress, and inadequate resources.

### 3. Effects of Online Learning in Crisis Contexts

Global research on online learning in crisis situations shows mixed outcomes:

Positive: Flexibility, access to recorded lectures, continuation of education despite disruptions.

Negative: Reduced interaction, learning gaps, and mental health impacts.

In Gaza, preliminary reports suggest that while online learning allowed students to continue their studies, it also amplified inequalities and strained both mental health and academic performance.

### 4. Research Gap

While NGOs and international organizations have collected data on school closures and online education in general, limited research exists specifically on higher education in Gaza during the last two years of war. This project aims to fill that gap by exploring:

How online learning affected university students’ academic performance, engagement, and well-being.

The effectiveness of different online education methods used in crisis conditions.

Opportunities to improve university resilience and digital learning strategies in Gaza.
