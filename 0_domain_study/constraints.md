## Constraints Considered

**Data Access**:
Data on student adaptability and online learning effectiveness may vary by region and educational level. We will rely on:

- International and national surveys (e.g., UNESCO, OECD, World Bank)

- -Academic articles and journals

- Open-access datasets from platforms like Kaggle or institutional repositories

- Reports from educational NGOs

**Technology & Infrastructure Limits**:
Differences in internet access, device availability, and digital literacy may influence both student participation and the quality of the data collected.

**Feasibility**:
We focus on what can realistically be measured with available data: student engagement, academic performance indicators, self-reported adaptability, and satisfaction with online learning.

**Scope**:
The study covers multiple educational levels (secondary and higher education) and focuses on the years 2020–2024, encompassing the post-pandemic adaptation period.

**Generalizability**:
Results may not fully apply to all regions due to differences in online learning infrastructure, cultural contexts, and policies. Cross-comparison will consider these limitations.
