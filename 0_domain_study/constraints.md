## Constraints We Considered

- **Data Access**:
University-level data in Gaza may be limited due to destruction, displacement, and restricted operations. We may rely on:

   - Student surveys

   - Local reports

   - NGO publications

   - Academic articles

- **Infrastructure Limits**:
Internet instability, electricity cuts, and device shortages affect both student participation and data collection.

- **Feasibility**:
Our focus stays on what is realistic in an emergency context:
simple platforms, resilience strategies, and low-cost solutions.

- **Scope**:
We concentrate only on universities, not schools, and only on the last two years of conflict.
