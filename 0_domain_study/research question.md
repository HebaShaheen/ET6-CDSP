## Research Question

**How have university students in Gaza experienced education during the last two years of war, especially with the shift to online learning, and what practical solutions can improve access, academic performance, and student wellbeing in such crisis conditions?**

This research question emerges directly from the lived reality in Gaza over the past two years and from the observed challenges university students faced in continuing their education under extreme conditions.

---

## We focus specifically on:

- Higher education, where disruptions have long-term consequences for careers and graduation.

- Online learning during war, which became the primary mode of instruction due to unsafe campuses and destroyed infrastructure.

- Student wellbeing and access, since academic performance is tightly connected to mental health, electricity shortages, and internet connectivity.

This question addresses both impact and solutions:
How the war reshaped learning—and what changes can realistically improve the situation.

## Why This Question Is Actionable

Our question pushes us to investigate real, measurable, and solvable problems. It requires us to:

- Document how students accessed online learning (internet, devices, platforms).

- Analyze how academic performance, attendance, or participation changed.

- Understand mental health impacts and their relationship to learning quality.

- Identify practical solutions that universities could implement.

By focusing on current conditions, barriers, and feasible improvements, this question leads directly to actionable outcomes rather than abstract descriptions.

## Why This Matters

This research question addresses a crisis with long-term consequences for an entire generation of Gaza’s university students. By studying what worked, what failed, and what can be improved, the project aims to produce insights that are:

- Useful for universities planning future emergency response strategies,

- Valuable for NGOs supporting higher education,

- Practical for students and faculty navigating online learning barriers,

- Relevant to any region where conflict forces rapid transitions to remote learning.

By identifying students’ real experiences and effective solutions, this research supports more equitable, resilient higher education during and after crisis.
