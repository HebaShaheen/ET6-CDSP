## Literature Review — Universities in Gaza & Online Learning During War
#### 1. Overview

The recent escalation of conflict in Gaza has created an urgent context for studying higher education. Universities experienced campus damage, closures, staff displacement, and interruptions to normal teaching. To maintain continuity, many institutions and instructors shifted to online learning—often as an emergency stopgap rather than a planned digital transformation. Existing literature and reports converge on three themes: **(1)** severe infrastructure and access constraints. 
**(2)** rapid but uneven pedagogical adaptation.
**(3)** significant psychosocial impacts on students and staff.


#### 2. Infrastructure & Access (The Digital Divide)

A central finding across humanitarian and education reports is that: 

- infrastructure failures (internet, electricity, devices) are the primary barrier to effective online education in Gaza. 
- Recurrent power cuts, damaged telecoms, limited household access to laptops/smartphones, and costly or unstable internet connections mean that many students cannot reliably join synchronous classes or access large recorded files.

>>> Studies of education in humanitarian settings emphasize that without minimum digital infrastructure, online modalities reach only a subset of learners and tend to amplify pre-existing inequalities.

#### 3. Pedagogical Adaptation & Quality of Instruction

Research on emergency remote teaching shows that quality depends less on the platform chosen and more on teacher preparedness, course redesign, and available support.
In Gaza, many instructors were forced to convert face-to-face lectures into online sessions without training, instructional design support, or robust learning-management systems.
The literature highlights common consequences: 
- reduced interactivity, reliance on lecture recordings.
- inconsistent assessment methods, and challenges maintaining academic integrity. 



#### 4. Student Engagement, Learning Outcomes & Assessment

Empirical studies from conflict and crisis contexts indicate mixed learning outcomes following rapid shifts online. 
Typical issues include: 
- reduced engagement.
- lower completion rates.
- widened achievement gaps—especially among lower-income students.

>>> For universities in Gaza, early reports and anecdotal evidence point to disrupted exam schedules, difficulties in conducting practical/lab work, and uneven grading standards. The literature recommends cautious interpretation of performance metrics collected during crises, because stress, displacement, and irregular assessment regimes confound comparisons with pre-crisis outcomes.

#### 5. Mental Health, Wellbeing & Learning Capacity

A robust theme across reports is the interaction between psychosocial stress and learning. Exposure to violence, loss, and displacement compromises concentration, memory, and emotional regulation—directly affecting students’ ability to learn and participate in online classes. Studies of education in emergencies argue that academic interventions must be coupled with psychosocial support (counseling, flexible deadlines, trauma-informed pedagogy) to be effective. 

#### 6. Institutional Resilience & Local Innovations

Despite constraints, universities and NGOs in Gaza have shown adaptive responses: 
- low-bandwidth content (text + audio).
- asynchronous modules.
- mobile-friendly resources.
- community learning hubs when safe.
- peer-support networks. 


#### 7. Policy, Coordination & External Support

Higher education response in conflict requires coordination among universities, ministries, international agencies, and donors. Reports suggest gaps in funding targeting higher education, ad-hoc coordination, and fragmented support for digital infrastructure and teacher training. The literature calls for integrated plans that combine short-term emergency measures with medium-term investments in infrastructure and capacity-building.

#### 8. Key Gaps / Opportunities for Research

Existing literature and field reports identify important gaps that your project can address:

Quantitative evidence on learning outcomes for Gaza university students pre- vs. during-conflict is sparse and inconsistent.

Systematic measurement of access (who could participate, how often, via what device/connection) is limited.

Comparative analysis of teaching modalities (live vs. asynchronous vs. mobile) under crisis conditions is lacking.

Evaluation of psychosocial supports integrated with pedagogy for improving outcomes is under-researched.

Documentation of small-scale innovations (what worked locally, why, and at what cost) is fragmented.

#### 9. Implications for This Project

The literature suggests the project should combine 
(1) descriptive measurement of access and engagement.
(2) qualitative insights from students/faculty about barriers and coping strategies.
(3) evaluation of feasible interventions (low-bandwidth delivery, mental-health linkages, assessment adaptations).
This mixed-methods approach aligns with calls in the literature for context-sensitive, evidence-driven solutions.
