### Project Motivation
- Rapid shift to online learning affected students differently
- Limited understanding of engagement, adaptability, and time use
- Data-driven analysis helps identify key patterns and challenges
This project explores how students experienced online learning across different contexts and time periods.

### Datasets Used
- Online Education System Review
  - performance before and after online learning
  - engagement and technology readiness
- Adaptability to Online Education
  - low, moderate, high adaptability
  - infrastructure and access factors
- COVID-19 Student Survey
  - study habits, sleep, social media
  - perceived time utilization

### Key Findings
- Overall improvement in marks after online learning
- Engagement levels vary by education level
- Better technology access supports stronger outcomes
- Social media use can reduce engagement 
- Most students show moderate adaptability
- High adaptability linked to:
  - stable internet
  - better devices
  - stronger financial conditions
- Gender and IT background have limited impact
- Time utilization varies widely among students
- Positive time use linked to:
  - higher self-study time
  - better class experiences
  - Low social media use 
  - Device type plays a role

### Future Work
- Advanced modeling and prediction
- Cross-dataset comparisons
- Deeper analysis of engagement factors
